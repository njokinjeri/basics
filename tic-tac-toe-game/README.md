# Tic Tac Toe Game

![Design preview Tic Tac Toe Challenge](./images/tic-tac-toe-project.png)

### Challenge

Users should be able to:

    - View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
    - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
    - Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person
    - Save the game state in the browser so that it’s preserved if the player refreshes their browser
    - Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so it’s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win
